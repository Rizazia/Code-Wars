Description:

Complete the solution so that the function will break up camel casing, using a space between words.
Example

"camelCasing"  =>  "camel Casing"
"identifier"   =>  "identifier"
""             =>  ""

    for (int i = 1; i < res.length(); i++){
      //if character at i is a capital and the previous index is not ' ' (which means the camel case is already broken)
